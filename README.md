# Getting Started with the .NET MAUI Linear Gauge Control

The [.NET MAUI Linear Gauge](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-linear-gauge?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-linear-gauge-github-samples) control is a multipurpose data visualization control that displays numerical values on a linear scale either horizontally or vertically. This project shows how to create and configure the Linear Gauge control of Syncfusion. This project also includes a code snippet to set a specific axis pointer value and customize the axis line height and width as well as how to add multiple axis ranges. 

## Supported platforms

## Features and Benefits

### Orientation
The appearance of the .NET MAUI Linear Gauge can be set to both vertical and horizontal orientations. You can choose horizontal gauge or vertical gauge depending on your requirements.

### Linear range
A range is a visual element that helps you quickly visualize where a data range falls on the axis track. You can add a child content inside the linear range. Multiple ranges with different styles can be added to a linear gauge. You can also customize the position of the range.

### Pointers
A [pointer](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/linear-gauge/pointers?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-linear-gauge-github-samples) is used to indicate a specific value on an scale. The gauge has three types of pointers: shape marker pointer, content marker pointer, and bar pointer. All the pointers can be customized as needed and you can also add multiple pointers in the Linear Gauge.

### Animation
Animate the gauge elements in a visually appealing manner when they are loaded or their values are changed.

### Interaction
The shape and content marker pointers in the Linear Gauge can be moved from one value to another by swiping or drag gestures.
